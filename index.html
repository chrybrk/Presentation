                        A Bezier curve is a mathematical curve that is widely used in computer graphics, animation, and design. 
                        <br>
                        Bezier curves are defined by control points that determine the shape and trajectory of the curve. The curve starts at the first control point, ends at the last control point, and is influenced by intermediate control points.
